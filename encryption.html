      <h3>What is encryption?</h3><br>
      <p>Encryption is to change information to something else, usually to prevent other people from viewing the original information. Text that has been encrypted is called ciphertext. In order to encrypt and to access the original information, a key must be used to change the encrypted message back to its original message, called plaintext or to change it to how it was. A basic form of encryption is a Caesar cipher. To encrypt a message in Caesar cipher, a message is taken and a key of a number, let's say 5, will change the letters five letters forward in the alphabet.<br><br><a href="https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher">Click here</a> for an interactive version and more information on Caesar cipher.</p>

      <h3>Why is encryption so important and why do we use it?</h3><br>
      Encryption helps keep your data safe from anyone else outside of your connection looking to use your data maliciously. By encrypting your data, we can keep other people from simply finding your data instead they would have zero idea what it is and what it means. <br> We use encryption for your passwords and to keep your connection private.

    <h3>How does modern encryption work?</h3> <br>
    As mentioned before, encryption scrambles messages to an unreadable state using a key but an important question arises from this. If you want to send some cipher text to someone, how does someone send the key over to that person to turn the message back to the original text? This problem is solved with the help of a public and a private key. The person with the original plaintext uses their public key to encrypt the message and then sends the message to the receiver who then uses their private key to decrypt the message. This allows the message to stay private between sender and receiver and to stop other people from viewing it.
